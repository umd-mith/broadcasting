From 1944-1946, he was a member of the NAEB Board of Directors. From 1947-1948, he was the NAEB Vice President. Also in 1947, he proposed the NAEB adopt a regional model, in which every U.S. state was divided into one of six regions.

In 1953 and 1954, Dunn once again served as the NAEB's Vice President.
