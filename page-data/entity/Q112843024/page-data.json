Clark began her storytelling career as a volunteer teacher's aide, eventually making it a full-time job. She was active in schools and libraries, as well as nursing homes, hospitals, and many other settings where her stories reached people of all ages. Clark was very involved in the Twin Cities Black Storytellers Alliance and the National Association of Black Storytellers, which gave her the Esteemed Elder Award in 2006. She hosted many radio programs for University of Minnesota station KUOM, including series \"Black Folk Tales\" and \"Sundown, with Mattie Clark\" as part of the Minnesota School of the Air in the 1970s. In the 1980s, Clark wrote a regular column for the Minnesota Spokesman-Recorder. She also appeared on radio station KMOJ in Minneapolis. Clark died in 2010.</p>","employer":null,"fieldOfWork":null,"inceptionDate":null,"cpfPageID":"Q112843024","naraURL":null,"occupation":null,"viafURL":["https://viaf.org/viaf/63289334"],"wikipediaURL":null,"worldCatURL":null,"snacURL":null,"associatedPlaces":null,"locURL":["https://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n97028497"],"collections":["KUOM"],"image":null,"references":[{"collection":"KUOM","series":["Black Folk Tales"],"title":"The Nature of the Bat","URL":"https://umedia.lib.umn.edu/item/p16022coll171:274"},{"collection":"KUOM","series":["Black Folk Tales"],"title":"Mattie Clark, Black Folk Tales","URL":"https://umedia.lib.umn.edu/item/p16022coll171:226"},{"collection":"KUOM","series":["Black Folk Tales"],"title":"He Who Has Lost All","URL":"https://umedia.lib.umn.edu/item/p16022coll171:366"},{"collection":"KUOM","series":["Black Folk Tales"],"title":"The Swallowing Monster","URL":"https://umedia.lib.umn.edu/item/p16022coll171:1243"},{"collection":"KUOM","series":["Sundown, With Mattie Clark"],"title":"Number 7","URL":"https://umedia.lib.umn.edu/item/p16022coll171:1320"},{"collection":"KUOM","series":["Black Folk Tales"],"title":"The Great Trickster","URL":"https://umedia.lib.umn.edu/item/p16022coll171:1369"},{"collection":"KUOM","series":["Black Folk Tales"],"title":"A Mother to Her Son","URL":"https://umedia.lib.umn.edu/item/p16022coll171:0"},{"collection":"KUOM","series":["Black Folk Tales"],"title":"John and the Lion","URL":"https://umedia.lib.umn.edu/item/p16022coll171:23"},{"collection":"KUOM","series":["Black Folk Tales"],"title":"High John de Conqueror","URL":"https://umedia.lib.umn.edu/item/p16022coll171:117"},{"collection":"KUOM","series":["Black Folk Tales"],"title":"Mattie Clark, Black Folk Tales","URL":"https://umedia.lib.umn.edu/item/p16022coll171:125"},{"collection":"KUOM","series":["Black Folk Tales"],"title":"Black Boy","URL":"https://umedia.lib.umn.edu/item/p16022coll171:135"},{"collection":"KUOM","series":["Black Folk Tales"],"title":"Black Girl","URL":"https://umedia.lib.umn.edu/item/p16022coll171:172"},{"collection":"KUOM","series":["Black Folk Tales"],"title":"Negro Market Song: Street Cries","URL":"https://umedia.lib.umn.edu/item/p16022coll171:177"},{"collection":"KUOM","series":["Black Folk Tales"],"title":"The Dog's Wisdom;
