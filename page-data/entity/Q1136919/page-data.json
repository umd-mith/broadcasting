Founded in 1858 as the Iowa Agricultural College and Model Farm, Iowa State became the nation's first designated land-grant institution when the Iowa Legislature accepted the provisions of the 1862 Morrill Act on September 11, 1862, making Iowa the first state in the nation to do so. On July 4, 1959, the college was officially renamed Iowa State University of Science and Technology. Iowa State was member of the Association of American Universities from 1958 until April 2022 and is classified among \"R1: Doctoral Universities â€“ Very high research activity\".
