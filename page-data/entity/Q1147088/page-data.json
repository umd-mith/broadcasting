While the institution is a formal unit of Stanford University, it maintains an independent board of overseers and relies on its own income and donations. In 1919, the institution began as a library founded by Stanford alumnus Herbert Hoover prior to him becoming President of the United States to house his archives gathered during the Great War. The Hoover Tower, an icon of Stanford University, was built to house the archives, then known as the Hoover War Collection (now the Hoover Institution Library and Archives), and contained material related to World War I, World War II, and other global events. The collection was renamed and transformed into a research institution and think tank in the mid-20th century. Its mission, as described by Herbert Hoover in 1959, is \"to recall the voice of experience against the making of war, and by the study of these records and their publication, to recall man's endeavors to make and preserve peace, and to sustain for America the safeguards of the American way of life.\" ","wikidataDescription":"American public policy think tank and research
