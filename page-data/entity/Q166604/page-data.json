He was also an author, television news show pundit, and university lecturer. For more than half a century, Broder reported on every presidential campaign, beginning with the 1956 Eisenhower–Stevenson race. Known as the \"dean\" of the Washington, D.C., press corps, Broder made over 400 appearances on NBC's Meet the Press. The Forbes Media Guide Five Hundred, 1994 stated in 1994: \"Broder is the best of an almost extinct species, the daily news reporter who doubles as an op-ed page columnist....With his solid reporting and shrewd analysis, Broder remains one of the sager voices in Washington.\" ","employer":["University of Maryland","Duke University"],"fieldOfWork":null,"inceptionDate":null,"cpfPageID":"Q166604","naraURL":["https://catalog.archives.gov/id/10582512"],"occupation":["journalist","university teacher"],"viafURL":["https://viaf.org/viaf/32090712"],"wikipediaURL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_S._Broder","worldCatURL":["https://worldcat.org/identities/lccn-n80037947"],"snacURL":["http://n2t.net/ark:/99166/w67h1sj7"],"associatedPlaces":null,"locURL":["https://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n80037947"],"collections":["NAEB","KUOM"],"image":null,"references":[{"collection":"NAEB","series":["The Washington Post columnists look at Richard Nixon after a year"],"title":"Twelve columnists take a look at Nixon","URL":"https://unlockingtheairwaves.org/episode/cpb-aacip-500-028pgw5q/"},{"collection":"KUOM","series":["None"],"title":"Can Our Political System Survive the Press by syndicate columnist David S.
