Historically, MBI has maintained positions that have identified it as non-charismatic, dispensational and generally Calvinistic. Today, MBI operates undergraduate programs and Moody Theological Seminary at the Chicago campus. Moody Theological Seminary also operates a satellite campus in Plymouth, Michigan; and Moody Aviation operates a flight school in Spokane, Washington. Emma Dryer organized the \"May Institute\", a weekly meeting for prayer and fellowship, with Moody's permission in 1883. Participants in the May Institute encouraged Moody to found a school to train young people for evangelism to carry on the Christian revival tradition.
