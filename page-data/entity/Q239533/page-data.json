Dubbed the \"Mother of the Blues\", she bridged earlier vaudeville and the authentic expression of southern blues, influencing a generation of blues singers. Gertrude Pridgett began performing as a teenager and became known as \"Ma\" Rainey after her marriage to Will \"Pa\" Rainey in 1904. They toured with the Rabbit Foot Minstrels and later formed their own group, Rainey and Rainey, Assassinators of the Blues. Her first recording was made in 1923. In the following five years, she made over 100 recordings, including \"Bo-Weevil Blues\" (1923), \"Moonshine Blues\" (1923), \"See See Rider Blues\" (1924), \"Ma Rainey's Black Bottom\" (1927), and \"Soon This Morning\" (1927).
