He held MA and PhD degrees in clinical psychology from Columbia University, and was certified by the American Board of Professional Psychology (ABPP). He also founded, and was the President of, the New York City-based Albert Ellis Institute. He is generally considered to be one of the originators of the cognitive revolutionary paradigm shift in psychotherapy and an early proponent and developer of cognitive-behavioral therapies. Based on a 1982 professional survey of US and Canadian psychologists, he was considered the second most influential psychotherapist in history (Carl Rogers ranked first in the survey; Sigmund Freud was ranked third). Psychology Today noted that, \"No individual—not even Freud himself—has had a greater impact on modern psychotherapy.\" ","wikidataDescription":"American psychologist (1913–2007)","employer":null,"fieldOfWork":["clinical psychology"],"inceptionDate":null,"cpfPageID":"Q313931","naraURL":null,"occupation":["sex educator","behaviour therapist","non-fiction writer","cognitive scientist","psychologist"],"viafURL":["https://viaf.org/viaf/108476297"],"wikipediaURL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Ellis","worldCatURL":["https://worldcat.org/identities/lccn-n79043405"],"snacURL":["http://n2t.net/ark:/99166/w67d37wt"],"associatedPlaces":null,"locURL":["https://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n79043405"],"collections":["NAEB","KUOM"],"image":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#081818","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/41cb0acb9c4acb5b109c99123920dc50/8f06b/Q313931.jpg","srcSet":"/static/41cb0acb9c4acb5b109c99123920dc50/806ed/Q313931.jpg 55w,\n/static/41cb0acb9c4acb5b109c99123920dc50/7c2db/Q313931.jpg 110w,\n/static/41cb0acb9c4acb5b109c99123920dc50/8f06b/Q313931.jpg 220w","sizes":"(min-width: 220px) 220px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/41cb0acb9c4acb5b109c99123920dc50/b0024/Q313931.webp 55w,\n/static/41cb0acb9c4acb5b109c99123920dc50/55565/Q313931.webp 110w,\n/static/41cb0acb9c4acb5b109c99123920dc50/f1362/Q313931.webp 220w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 220px) 220px, 100vw"}]},"width":220,"height":145}}},"references":[{"collection":"NAEB","series":"Cooper Union forum","title":"#4 - Spring 1970: Psychology Today","URL":"https://unlockingtheairwaves.org/episode/cpb-aacip-500-804xms86/"},{"collection":"KUOM","series":"None","title":"Rationality and Sexuality by Alber Ellis","URL":"https://umedia.lib.umn.edu/item/p16022coll171:538"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"60995f15-fe6b-5606-90f5-6cb23a4e5139"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1736560250","3956795357"]}
