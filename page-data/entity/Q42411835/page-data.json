All but three of the station's initial 15-minute programs were for grade school students; the exceptions were high school fare on poetry, choral music, and business. KSLH devoted itself almost entirely to instruction for most of its life. By 1953, it broadcast from 9:10 a.m. to 4:15 p.m., matching the school day; it produced about 300 educational programs in a given year, alongside content obtained in the National Association of Educational Broadcasters program exchange. In its first decade of broadcasting, the station produced 2,878 fifteen-minute programs. In addition to NAEB-supplied programs, KSLH educational broadcasts were also supplied by the state of Missouri, the United Nations, and even the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation and BBC. As a member of the NAEB, KSLH hosted the 1954 In-School Radio Program Writers' Seminar to bolster school-oriented educational radio programs</p>\n<p>Around 1988, KSLH began to face uncertainty as to its future due to budget cuts by the St. Louis school board. After its first buyer fell though, a second buyer emerged in October 1995: Community Broadcasting, Inc., the non-profit stations arm of the Bott Radio Network.</p>","employer":null,"fieldOfWork":null,"inceptionDate":null,"cpfPageID":"Q42411835","naraURL":null,"occupation":null,"viafURL":null,"wikipediaURL":null,"archivedWorldCatURL":null,"snacURL":["http://n2t.net/ark:/99166/w65j8841"],"wikidataURL":["http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q42411835"],"associatedPlaces":["St. Louis","United States of America","Saint Louis (Mo.)","Missouri"],"locURL":null,"collections":["NAEB"],"image":null,"references":[{"collection":"NAEB","series":["\"Let's find out, grade 2\""],"title":"Flash","URL":"https://unlockingtheairwaves.org/episode/cpb-aacip-500-n58cm36h/"},{"collection":"NAEB","series":["\"Let's find out, grade 2\""],"title":"What do you hear?","URL":"https://unlockingtheairwaves.org/episode/cpb-aacip-500-7d2q921c/"},{"collection":"NAEB","series":["\"Let's find out, grade 2\""],"title":"What makes it go?","URL":"https://unlockingtheairwaves.org/episode/cpb-aacip-500-zw18r53h/"},{"collection":"NAEB","series":["\"Let's find out, grade 2\""],"title":"It's warm","URL":"https://unlockingtheairwaves.org/episode/cpb-aacip-500-1r6n3r4t/"},{"collection":"NAEB","series":["\"Let's find out, grade 2\""],"title":"Magnets and electromagnets","URL":"https://unlockingtheairwaves.org/episode/cpb-aacip-500-5m628x1h/"},{"collection":"NAEB","series":["\"Let's find out, grade 2\""],"title":"How can we tell?","URL":"https://unlockingtheairwaves.org/episode/cpb-aacip-500-rn30746v/"},{"collection":"NAEB","series":["\"Let's find out, grade 2\""],"title":"I'm cold","URL":"https://unlockingtheairwaves.org/episode/cpb-aacip-500-sj19qq6n/"},{"collection":"NAEB","series":["\"Let's find out, grade 2\""],"title":"Sparks","URL":"https://unlockingtheairwaves.org/episode/cpb-aacip-500-pz51m87q/"},{"collection":"NAEB","series":["None"],"title":"NAEB Newsletter (April 1952)","URL":"https://www.unlockingtheairwaves.org/document/naeb-b111-f07-06/"},{"collection":"NAEB","series":["None"],"title":"Report of the NAEB: In-School Writers Seminar (June 7-11, 1954)","URL":"https://www.unlockingtheairwaves.org/document/naeb-b106-f01-09/"},{"collection":"NAEB","series":["None"],"title":"Committees Programming Practices, 1968-1969","URL":"https://www.unlockingtheairwaves.org/document/naeb-b034-f01/"},{"collection":"NAEB","series":["None"],"title":"Programs, Correspondence, 1953","URL":"https://www.unlockingtheairwaves.org/document/naeb-b071-f03/"},{"collection":"NAEB","series":["None"],"title":"Programs, Correspondence, 1968, August-December","URL":"https://www.unlockingtheairwaves.org/document/naeb-b071-f05/"},{"collection":"NAEB","series":["None"],"title":"Surveys, 1952-1957, 1962-1964 (1)","URL":"https://www.unlockingtheairwaves.org/document/naeb-b081-f01/"},{"collection":"NAEB","series":["None"],"title":"Foundations, Kellogg, 1954, July-December","URL":"https://www.unlockingtheairwaves.org/document/naeb-b056-f07/"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"b6098763-db00-5e46-be29-d20b1e8d140e"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1736560250","3956795357"]}
