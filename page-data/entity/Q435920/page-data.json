Serling was active in politics, both on and off the screen, and helped form television industry standards. He was known as the \"angry young man\" of Hollywood, clashing with television executives and sponsors over a wide range of issues, including censorship, racism, and war. Serling was born on December 25, 1924, in Syracuse, New York, to a Jewish family. He was the second of two sons born to Esther (née Cooper, 1893–1958), a homemaker, and Samuel Lawrence Serling (1892–1945). Serling's father had worked as a secretary and amateur inventor before his children were born but took on his father-in-law's profession as a grocer to earn a steady income. : 15  Sam Serling later became a butcher after the Great Depression forced the store to close.
