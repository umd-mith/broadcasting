He oversaw the work of some of the finest talents of the day—writers and actors such as Lister Sinclair, Mavor Moore, W. O. Mitchell, Jane Mallett, John Drainie, Barry Morse, Christopher Plummer, James Doohan, and many others. Allan attempted to make the transition to television in the 1950s, but never matched the extraordinary success he'd reached in the medium of radio. He later became the first Artistic Director of the Shaw Festival (1963–65) and was a prolific freelance writer and guest commentator on CBC Radio and Television until his death.
