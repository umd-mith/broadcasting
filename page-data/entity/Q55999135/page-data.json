She graduated in 1908 from the Millersville Normal School, and earned a B.S. (1920) and M.A. from Columbia University under Leta Hollingworth, while she served as director of research for the Rutherford and Perth Amboy, New Jersey, public schools. There she did her first research studies, collecting data on children's drawings. In 1921, Goodenough began research work with Lewis Terman at Stanford University, participating in studies of gifted children. In 1924, she left for Minneapolis, Minnesota, to work in the Minneapolis Child Guidance Clinic and as an assistant professor at the University of Minnesota (1925-1947). Goodenough's first book was titled Measurement of Intelligence by Drawings (1925). Until this time, nonverbal I.Q. tests were low in validity and reliability, or too long to give. Goodenough developed the Draw a Man Test, in which each child tested was given ten minutes to draw a man, and she developed criteria for rating each drawing. Results correlated with written I.Q. tests and the Draw a Man Test was widely used until the 1950s.</p> From the description of Dale B.
