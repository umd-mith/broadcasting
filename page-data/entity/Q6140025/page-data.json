He attended Ohio State University for his undergraduate education and, after a brief career as a journalist, he returned there for a career in teaching and administration. In 1942 he left to accept the position of president at the University of Wyoming. After only three years he was recruited to become the eighth president of the University of Minnesota. During his time at the University of Minnesota he oversaw a period of immense growth; enrollment at the school more than doubled in a single year due in large part to returning servicemen using the G.I. Bill to pursue a college education. Morrill put forward a plan to expand the campus across the Mississippi River to ensure the university would have room to accommodate the coming generation of baby boomers. After retiring in 1960 he moved to Ohio. He died in 1979.
