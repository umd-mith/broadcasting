It carries programs from NPR and Public Radio International. KFJM shares its coverage area with Minnesota Public Radio outlets KNTN and KQMN, both licensed to Thief River Falls, Minnesota. This makes Grand Forks one of the smallest markets with competing NPR stations. KFJM signed on in 1995 as KFJY on 90.7 MHz. It was the University of North Dakota's third radio station, joining the original KFJM, an AM station dating back to 1923, and KFJM-FM on 89.3 MHz, which had been established in 1976. KFJY simulcast KFJM with an adult album alternative (AAA) format and jazz overnight. During April 1997, both stations went off the air as the floodwaters went through the transmitter site.
