It has a Christian talk and teaching radio format. KFUO is one of the oldest continuous operating Christian radio stations in the United States, with its first broadcast on October 26, 1924; 97 years ago (1924-10-26). Owned and operated by The Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod (LCMS), its radio studios and offices are in the LCMS headquarters in Kirkwood, Missouri. KFUO is a daytimer station. By day, it is powered at 5,000 watts, using a non-directional antenna. But KFUO operates on the same frequency as Class A KOA (AM) Denver. So KFUO must sign off at sunset, Denver time. As such, the on-air hours vary depending on time of year. The station's website plays sacred music when the 850 signal is dark. KFUO broadcasts using HD Radio technology. The transmitter is on the grounds of the Concordia Seminary in Clayton.
