It was endowed by a bequest of $250,000 left by John Lowell Jr., who died in 1836. The Institute began work in the winter of 1839/40, and an inaugural lecture was given on December 31, 1839, by Edward Everett. Lowell's will set up an endowment with a principal of over $1 million (in 1909[clarification needed]), stipulating 10% of its net annual income was to be added back to help it grow. None of the fund was to be invested in a building for the lectures. The trustees of the Boston Athenaeum were made visitors of the fund, but the trustee of the fund is authorized to select his own successor. In naming a successor, the institute's trustee must always choose in preference to all others some male descendant of Lowell's grandfather, John Lowell, provided there is one who is competent to hold the office of trustee, and of the name of Lowell. The sole trustee so appointed is solely responsible for the entire selection of the lecturers and the subjects of lectures.[citation needed] ","employer":null,"fieldOfWork":null,"inceptionDate":"1839","cpfPageID":"Q6693228","naraURL":null,"occupation":null,"viafURL":["https://viaf.org/viaf/148897843"],"wikipediaURL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lowell_Institute","worldCatURL":["https://worldcat.org/identities/lccn-n50081051"],"snacURL":["http://n2t.net/ark:/99166/w6xd52kp"],"associatedPlaces":["United States of America"],"locURL":["https://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n50081051"],"collections":["NAEB"],"image":null,"references":[{"collection":"NAEB","series":["They bent our ear"],"title":"Captain Basil Hall","URL":"https://unlockingtheairwaves.org/episode/cpb-aacip-500-6m335r5s/"},{"collection":"NAEB","series":["They bent our ear"],"title":"Captain Basil Hall","URL":"https://unlockingtheairwaves.org/episode/cpb-aacip-500-rr1pmf0x/"},{"collection":"NAEB","series":["They bent our ear"],"title":"Frances Trollope","URL":"https://unlockingtheairwaves.org/episode/cpb-aacip-500-np1wjj7g/"},{"collection":"NAEB","series":["They bent our ear"],"title":"Frances Trollope","URL":"https://unlockingtheairwaves.org/episode/cpb-aacip-500-tt4fsd99/"},{"collection":"NAEB","series":["They bent our ear"],"title":"Harriet Martineau","URL":"https://unlockingtheairwaves.org/episode/cpb-aacip-500-v698bk21/"},{"collection":"NAEB","series":["They bent our ear"],"title":"Harriet Martineau","URL":"https://unlockingtheairwaves.org/episode/cpb-aacip-500-j678xj10/"},{"collection":"NAEB","series":["They bent our ear"],"title":"Francis Joseph Grund","URL":"https://unlockingtheairwaves.org/episode/cpb-aacip-500-g15tc68f/"},{"collection":"NAEB","series":["They bent our ear"],"title":"Francis Joseph Grund","URL":"https://unlockingtheairwaves.org/episode/cpb-aacip-500-kw57jd1b/"},{"collection":"NAEB","series":["They bent our ear"],"title":"Captain Frederick Marryat","URL":"https://unlockingtheairwaves.org/episode/cpb-aacip-500-8w384b46/"},{"collection":"NAEB","series":["They bent our ear"],"title":"Captain Frederick Marryat","URL":"https://unlockingtheairwaves.org/episode/cpb-aacip-500-m9023j1k/"},{"collection":"NAEB","series":["They bent our ear"],"title":"James Fenimore Cooper","URL":"https://unlockingtheairwaves.org/episode/cpb-aacip-500-6q1sk25g/"},{"collection":"NAEB","series":["They bent our ear"],"title":"James Fenimore Cooper","URL":"https://unlockingtheairwaves.org/episode/cpb-aacip-500-5x25fr7d/"},{"collection":"NAEB","series":["They bent our ear"],"title":"James Silk Buckingham","URL":"https://unlockingtheairwaves.org/episode/cpb-aacip-500-zs2kbw06/"},{"collection":"NAEB","series":["They bent our ear"],"title":"Chevalier and Grattan","URL":"https://unlockingtheairwaves.org/episode/cpb-aacip-500-r20rwd6b/"},{"collection":"NAEB","series":["They bent our ear"],"title":"Charles Dickens","URL":"https://unlockingtheairwaves.org/episode/cpb-aacip-500-zp3vzk74/"},{"collection":"NAEB","series":["They bent our ear"],"title":"Charles Dickens","URL":"https://unlockingtheairwaves.org/episode/cpb-aacip-500-9g5gg327/"},{"collection":"NAEB","series":["They bent our ear"],"title":"Alexander Mackay","URL":"https://unlockingtheairwaves.org/episode/cpb-aacip-500-pg1hnt97/"},{"collection":"NAEB","series":["They bent our ear"],"title":"Sir Charles Lyell","URL":"https://unlockingtheairwaves.org/episode/cpb-aacip-500-028pgv87/"},{"collection":"NAEB","series":["They bent our ear"],"title":"William Makepeace Thackeray","URL":"https://unlockingtheairwaves.org/episode/cpb-aacip-500-4746tw4b/"},{"collection":"NAEB","series":["They bent our ear"],"title":"Fredrika Bremer","URL":"https://unlockingtheairwaves.org/episode/cpb-aacip-500-r49g8p5m/"},{"collection":"NAEB","series":["They bent our ear"],"title":"Fredrika Bremer","URL":"https://unlockingtheairwaves.org/episode/cpb-aacip-500-1r6n3s80/"},{"collection":"NAEB","series":["None"],"title":"NAEB Newsletter (February-March 1952)","URL":"https://www.unlockingtheairwaves.org/document/naeb-b111-f07-05/"},{"collection":"NAEB","series":["None"],"title":"NAEB Newsletter (May 1952)","URL":"https://www.unlockingtheairwaves.org/document/naeb-b111-f07-07/"},{"collection":"NAEB","series":["None"],"title":"Miscellaneous Documents of the National Association of Educational Broadcasters (1946)","URL":"https://www.unlockingtheairwaves.org/document/naeb-b102-f02-15/"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"49c1d453-e9c3-5d9c-82ba-3a80cda056d4"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1736560250","3956795357"]}
