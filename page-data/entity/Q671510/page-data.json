It differs from other non-profit membership media organizations such as Associated Press, in that it was established by an act of Congress, and most of its member stations are owned by government entities (often public universities). It serves as a national syndicator to a network of over 1,000 public radio stations in the United States. NPR produces and distributes news and cultural programming. The organization's flagship shows are two drive-time news broadcasts: Morning Edition and the afternoon All Things Considered, both carried by most NPR member stations, and among the most popular radio programs in the country. As of March 2018[update], the drive-time programs attract an audience of 14.9 million and 14.7 million per week, respectively.
