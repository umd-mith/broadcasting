With funding from the Ford Foundation, the network began broadcasting on six radio stations on April 3, 1961. A forerunner was formed in 1925 as the Association of College and University Broadcasting Stations, then renamed the National Association of Educational Broadcasters in 1934. In 1951 a grant from the W. K. Kellogg Foundation enabled the network to become the \"(NAEB) Tape Network\", based at the University of Illinois.
