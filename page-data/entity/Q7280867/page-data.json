KUOM covers the Minneapolis–Saint Paul metropolitan area, and extends its reach with two low-power broadcast relay stations and one full-power repeater. Owned by the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities, the station is operated by both faculty and students. The KUOM studios are located at the Rarig Center on the University of Minnesota campus, while the station transmitter is in Falcon Heights. Besides a standard analog transmission, KUOM is also available online. KUOM's AM signal operates with a non-directional antenna located on the St. Paul/Falcon Heights campus. Due to its 770 kHz frequency located low on the band combined with the region's flat terrain and excellent soil conductivity, the station's AM coverage is comparable to that of a full-power FM station, thus 770 can be heard throughout the Twin Cities area, with grade B coverage in St. Cloud and Mankato. However, the AM is licensed to operate during daylight hours only in order to protect WABC in New York at night. The hours of operation vary from month to month, reflecting local sunrise and sunset times, with the day's sign on and signoff changing from month to month; signoff, for example, ranges from 4:30 p.m. in winter to 9:00 p.m. in summer.
