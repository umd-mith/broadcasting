It produces programs for local, regional and national television broadcast, operates numerous websites, and produces rich media content for Web distribution. Twin Cities PBS also serves the Mankato market (via K26CS-D [relaying KTCA] and K29IE-D [relaying KTCI] in nearby St. James through the local municipal-operated Cooperative TV [CTV] network of translators ), as that area does not have a PBS member station of its own.
