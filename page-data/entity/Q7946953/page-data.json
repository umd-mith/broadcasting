WBAA's format is exclusively news-oriented with programming from National Public Radio (NPR), while WBAA-FM features a mixture of NPR news and classical music. The stations are currently owned by Purdue University and broadcast from studios in the Edward C. Elliott Hall of Music on the Purdue campus, with transmitters south of Lafayette at the Throckmorton Purdue Agricultural Center. WBAA is the oldest operating radio station in Indiana, having gone on the air in 1922 and with several antecedents on the Purdue campus. Originally a service noted for its limited agricultural extension and educational programming as well as Purdue sports broadcasts, it gradually improved its facilities and expanded its output over its first 20 years on air. The station was one of NPR's charter members in 1971. It expanded to a second FM station in 1993.
