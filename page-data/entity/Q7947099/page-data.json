Financed by corporate underwriting, government funding and listener contributions, the station is affiliated with both National Public Radio and Public Radio Exchange; it also broadcasts content from American Public Media. The station and its parent organization were previously known as Chicago Public Radio; since 2010, the parent company has been known as Chicago Public Media. Some of the organization's output—including nationally syndicated productions This American Life and Wait Wait... Don't Tell Me!—is branded as either from WBEZ or Chicago Public Media. In addition to a standard analog transmission, WBEZ broadcasts over two HD Radio digital subchannels, operates full-power repeater WBEQ (90.7 FM) in Morris, and is available online. WBEZ-HD2, carrying a user-generated content format focused on \"urban alternative\" and branded Vocalo.org, is also relayed over WBEW (89.5 FM) in Chesterton, Indiana.
