The station is owned by Baltimore City Community College. Its broadcast tower is located near Pikesville, Maryland at (39°23′11.0″N 76°43′51.0″W﻿ / ﻿39.386389°N 76.730833°W﻿ / 39.386389; -76.730833). WBJC-FM originally broadcast on 88.1 MHz with a 250 watt transmitter obtained from military surplus by Edward Arnold, chief engineer, to serve as a workshop for his students of radio and for those of the Department of Speech, Drama and Radio, headed by Clarence DeHaven at the Baltimore Junior College, which shared the campus of the Baltimore high school, known as Baltimore City College. Its antenna had a gain of -3db so that the effective radiated power was only 125 watts. However the antenna was on the top of the school's tower, which enjoyed a great view of almost all of Baltimore except for a few valleys. and its signal covered the City of Baltimore and much of surrounding counties. Generally speaking the station operated a flexible schedule as it was largely dependent on student volunteers. Generally the station signed off at 5 PM, but sports events often extended the broadcast day and led to weekend operation.
