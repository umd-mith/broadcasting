It is the largest of three NPR member stations in Boston, along with WGBH and WUMB-FM and produces several nationally distributed programs, including On Point, Here and Now and Open Source. WBUR previously produced Car Talk, Only a Game, and The Connection (which was cancelled on August 5, 2005). RadioBoston, launched in 2007, is its only purely local show. WBUR's positioning statement is \"Boston's NPR News Station\". WBUR also carries its programming on two other stations serving Cape Cod and the Islands: WBUH (89.1 FM) in Brewster, and WBUA (92.7 FM) in Tisbury. The latter station, located on Martha's Vineyard, uses the frequency formerly occupied by WMVY. In 1998, the station helped launch WRNI in Providence, Rhode Islandâ€”the first NPR station within that state's borders. It has since sold the station to a local group.
