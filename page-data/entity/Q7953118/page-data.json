It produced local programming for 59 years until March 1, 2009, when it became a part of Cincinnati Public Radio. The station serves southwest Ohio and southeast Indiana. WMUB started as a student-operated station in the 1940s and turned FM in 1950. Once known for its “Rhythm and News”, it is now a full-time satellite of WVXU in Cincinnati.
