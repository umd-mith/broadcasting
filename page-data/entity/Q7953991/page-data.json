It airs local Catholic programming in addition to EWTN Global Catholic Radio. Its programs are simulcast over WSGR, 88.3 FM in New Boston, Ohio. WVSG broadcasts with 5,000 watts during the daytime, and 790 watts at night, from a transmitter site located near Upper Arlington and Grove City. A single non-directional tower is used during the day, offering secondary coverage to almost half of Ohioâ€“as far west as Dayton and the outer suburbs of Cincinnati and as far north as the outer suburbs of Toledo. At night, six towers are used in a directional pattern to protect the signal of the frequency's clear-channel station, WBAP in Fort Worth, Texas, concentrating the signal around the Columbus area.
