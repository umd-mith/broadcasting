Since June 2011, the station has employed exclusively a news and talk format; until then, the station carried at least some classical music. The station maintains studios on Mainstream Drive north of downtown Nashville, studios that some consider among the finest radio production facilities in the U.S. Nashville Public Radio offers five program streams: WPLN (AM); WPLN-FM; HD-2 and HD-3, which are multicasts from the main FM channel; and WNXP (see below). All five are also streamed on the radio station's website.
