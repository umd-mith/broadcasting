A native of Eau Claire, Wisconsin, he graduated from the University of Wisconsin at Madison (UW-M) with a degree in journalism. In 1930, he became a reporter for the Tulsa Tribune, where he was promoted to managing editor in 1937. During World War II, he moved to Washington, D.C. and worked in the press division of the Office of Censorship. After the War, he joined the Minneapolis Star-Tribune as managing editor. He was later appointed executive editor and vice president. In 1961, he became editor of the Houston Chronicle. After leaving Houston, he became vice president and editorial director of the World Book Encyclopedia Science Service and vice president of The Chicago Daily News and Sun-Times. Steven retired to Sarasota, Florida, where he and his wife lived until his death on August 6, 1991. Bill Steven was born September 10, 1908 in Eau Claire, Wisconsin. His father, J.D.R. Steven, was born in Scotland and emigrated to the United States from Canada. His mother, Merle Pickford, was a Wisconsin native. According to an obituary, Bill showed a strong interest in journalism by publishing his own neighborhood newspaper when he was only eight years old. He was selected as editor of the first edition of the Eau Claire high school newspaper in 1926. Although he was legally old enough to graduate from high school (age 14), UW-M would not accept his application because of his age. So, he remained in high school for an extra year, during which he founded The High School News. He enrolled in the University of Wisconsin, where he worked on the school newspaper, served as editor of the Daily Cardinal during his senior year and graduated with a degree in journalism.
