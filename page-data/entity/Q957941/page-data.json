Kunstler was an active member of the National Lawyers Guild, a board member of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and the co-founder of the Center for Constitutional Rights (CCR), the \"leading gathering place for radical lawyers in the country.\" Kunstler's defense of the Chicago Seven from 1969 to 1970 led The New York Times to label him \"the country's most controversial and, perhaps, its best-known lawyer\". Kunstler is also well known for defending members of the Revolutionary Communist Party, Catonsville Nine, Black Panther Party, Weather Underground Organization, the Attica Prison rioters, Meir Kahane assassin El Sayyid Nosair, and the American Indian Movement. He also won a de facto segregation case regarding the District of Columbia's public schools and \"disinterred, singlehandedly\" the concept of federal criminal removal jurisdiction in the 1960s. Kunstler refused to defend right-wing groups, such as the Minutemen, on the grounds that \"I only defend those whose goals I share. I'm not a lawyer for hire. I only defend those I love.\" ","wikidataDescription":"American lawyer and civil rights activist (1919-1995)","employer":null,"fieldOfWork":null,"inceptionDate":null,"cpfPageID":"Q957941","naraURL":null,"occupation":["lawyer","actor"],"viafURL":["https://viaf.org/viaf/15662602"],"wikipediaURL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Kunstler","worldCatURL":["https://worldcat.org/identities/lccn-n81002785"],"snacURL":["http://n2t.net/ark:/99166/w6p273hb"],"associatedPlaces":null,"locURL":["https://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n81002785"],"collections":["NFCB","KUOM"],"image":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#d8c8b8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/broadcasting/static/313a47abef6b5370a75f2fccdabd2bcd/b624b/Q957941.jpg","srcSet":"/broadcasting/static/313a47abef6b5370a75f2fccdabd2bcd/66484/Q957941.jpg 55w,\n/broadcasting/static/313a47abef6b5370a75f2fccdabd2bcd/8e378/Q957941.jpg 110w,\n/broadcasting/static/313a47abef6b5370a75f2fccdabd2bcd/b624b/Q957941.jpg 220w","sizes":"(min-width: 220px) 220px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/broadcasting/static/313a47abef6b5370a75f2fccdabd2bcd/045cd/Q957941.webp 55w,\n/broadcasting/static/313a47abef6b5370a75f2fccdabd2bcd/f747e/Q957941.webp 110w,\n/broadcasting/static/313a47abef6b5370a75f2fccdabd2bcd/dbe1c/Q957941.webp 220w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 220px) 220px, 100vw"}]},"width":220,"height":296}}},"references":[{"collection":"NFCB","series":"None","title":"William Kunstler: At Antioch College, Chicago seven, Black liberation, undated","URL":"https://hdl.handle.net/1903.1/41928"},{"collection":"KUOM","series":"None","title":"Dennis Banks, Russell Means, and William Kunstler","URL":"https://umedia.lib.umn.edu/item/p16022coll171:3978"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"042f72ef-8904-5179-9932-2a4c0ded8f3c"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1736560250","3956795357"]}
